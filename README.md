This project presents a basic yet powerful movie recommendation system built using Python and Pandas, focusing on analyzing user ratings to generate meaningful suggestions. The primary goal of the system is to explore the dataset efficiently, identify user preferences, and recommend movies that align closely with a viewer’s taste. The project starts by importing and cleaning the data, ensuring that missing or inconsistent entries are handled properly. Using Pandas, various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to understand rating distributions, identify the most popular and highly rated movies, and uncover trends within the data. A pivot table is created, mapping users to their movie ratings, which serves as the foundation for calculating similarities between different movies. Based on these rating patterns, the system finds movies that have been liked by users with similar preferences, offering suggestions that feel intuitive and personalized. Although this project uses simple correlation-based methods for recommendations, it lays the groundwork for more complex systems like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Pandas’ powerful functions like groupby, pivot_table, and corrwith are heavily utilized to make the process both efficient and interpretable. Overall, this project not only demonstrates how to build a basic recommendation engine but also highlights the importance of data exploration and analysis in creating intelligent systems. Future enhancements could include refining recommendations using more advanced machine learning techniques, introducing genre-based filtering, and deploying the system via a simple web application to make it interactive. This project is ideal for beginners who are interested in the intersection of data science and recommender systems, and it provides a solid foundation for deeper work in recommendation algorithms
